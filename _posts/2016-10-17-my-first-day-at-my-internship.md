I have spent the last five months in a code school in Portland Oregon. We had four five week modules and I specialized in Ruby and Ruby on Rails development. The course was 40 hours a week and it feels good to finish and finally be working with what we had learned.

The code school I went to guarantees a placement in an internship. The internship is five weeks long and you are placed with a pair. I was super excited to be paired with one of my favorite people to work with from school. She and I work well together and I think we will be able get a lot of things done during the upcoming weeks.

We got placed at a local web development agency in Beaverton. Overall the day went pretty well. We learned how to download and use docker and our boss/mentor taught us a lot of new commands to use in the command line. We were working on updating html in an application that uses php and symphony. I have never worked with either so it was great to see new code and play around with the html on a real project. It's way better to work on something that is real than another school project!

I am trying to understand docker because it seems like a really valuable tool and something that would be useful in a future job. I watched the video below to get a high level understanding of docker and what it does.

Today we were introduced to gitlab which is a gui for git. We had previously used github at our code school so it took a little setup and getting used to. It is actually pretty similar to github (since they both are just gui for git the commands are the same).
