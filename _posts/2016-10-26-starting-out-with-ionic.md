My intern partner and I have started our internship project! We are making an app that has a Ruby on Rails API that supports an ionic app that will be able to be downloaded on Apple and Android phones. Our goal is to get a MVP out on the app store before the end of our five weeks at the agency where we were placed. I've never used mobile development frameworks before so there might be a bit of a learning curve.

According to the ionic documentation:
<block> Ionic is an HTML5 mobile app development framework targeted at building hybrid mobile apps. Hybrid apps are essentially small websites running in a browser shell in an app that have access to the native platform layer.</block>
